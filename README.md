# Indian-Liver-Patient-Records
Patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors. This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.  Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90". Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. I will be applying Machine Learning approaches(and eventually comparing them) for classifying whether a person is suffering from liver disease or not.
